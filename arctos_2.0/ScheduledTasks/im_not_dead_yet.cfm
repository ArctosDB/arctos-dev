				An Arctos monitoring script has detected a problem.
				<cfif application.version is "test">
					<p>
						A check-in email was not received from production. This may mean that there is a problem
						with the primary system.
					</p>
				<cfelse>
					<p>
						A check-in email was not received from test. This means the monitoring system is not functioning properly.

				<p>
					Arctos contacts may be found at https://arctosdb.org/arctos-down/. Please ensure that at least
					one of them is aware of this message if you cannot solve the problem.
				</p>

				 To diagnose the problem, check the following items:
				<p>
					Check that both arctos.database.museum and arctos-test.tacc.utexas.edu are responsive.
				</p>
				<p>
					Check that email is being sent from both. The mailserver is very susceptible to disk space issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Check that scheduled tasks are running (these alerts come from im_not_dead_yet which should run twice hourly on test and prod).
					The CF scheduler sometimes spitefully destroys it's own config files (neo-cron.xml), particularly after a crash or near-crash.
					Patch a bare one in, restart CF, rebuild scheduled tasks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Check that #p.monitor_email_addr#@gmail.com is properly receiving email and allowing IMAP connections to Arctos and Arctos Test.
					The password is	available under Global Settings.
				</p>
				<p>Check that the password to #p.monitor_email_addr#@gmail.com works and matches at test and prod.</p>

				<p>
					If you are logged in to #Application.serverRootURL# with manage_collection permissions and you are SURE that the right
					people are aware of this issue,	you may pause the monitoring scripts for 12 hours by visiting
					<a href="#Application.serverRootURL#/Admin/pause_monitor.cfm">#Application.serverRootURL#/Admin/pause_monitor.cfm</a>.
